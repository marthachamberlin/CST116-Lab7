Module 7: Lab 7


Combining strings
Write a program that prompts for the user’s first and last names.
Ensure that the first character of each name is uppercase.
Declare a third array that will hold the user’s last name and first name separated by a comma and a space.
Use loops to iterate through the names a character at a time, storing them into the full name array. Don’t forget the TERMINATING CHARACTER!
Be sure to break this into functions so that it adheres to a good modular design.

string vs cString
In class, we went over the difference between string & cString for copy, concatenate and compare.
Do the same thing for the following functions:
* Reverse the characters
* Convert characters to double
* Convert characters to long
* Convert characters to int
* Convert long to string & cString
* Convert integer to string & cString
Be sure to break this into functions so that it adheres to a good modular design.

String manipulations
Write a program that includes the following three functions:
1. IsPalindrome – This function returns true if the string parameter is a palindrome, false if not. A palindrome is any group of characters (i.e., a word) which appears the same written both forward and backward.
2. IsAlphaStr – This function returns true if the string you pass it contains all alphabetic characters. If the parameter does NOT contain all alpha characters, return false.
3. CountChar – This function simply counts and return the number of times a specific character occurs in a string. This function will take 2 parameters: the string to check and the specific character you are looking for.
Be sure to break this into functions so that it adheres to a good modular design.
